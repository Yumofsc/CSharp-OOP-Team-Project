properly, use delegates and events like it is recommended in MSDN, use inheritance, abstraction
and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling.
• Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use
https://github.com/). TFS or SVN are not allowed. Use Git.
• Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types).
